# Dominosa-Solver_L1-S2

First encounter with Prolog was hard, well it's still hard...
But that's why this project was more than very difficult, even if from the start thought that it was impossible...
Without knowing a concrete way to make this, progressing bit by bit was the only thing that I could do.
Until I finally did it, and that was sooo satisfying.

Solver is functional, and should work in at least 99% of scenarios (Higher chancer of failing the more big the game is)
